# DSA-Sunstone
### This Repository contains 3 projects based on DSA in python, highlighting the concepts covered in Ace Academy classes by Sunstone.

Topics implemented: 
Nodes creation, Dictionary, Arrays, Lists, Tree, Graph, Minimum Spanning Tree, etc. 


##1. Social Network Analysis

Features: 
Implemented graph representation using adjacency lists or adjacency matrices.
Calculated and displayed centrality measures such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality.
Identified key users within the network.
Detected communities within the network.
Visualized the network structure using a graph visualization library.
Highlighted key users and communities in the visualization.

##2. Traffic Management

Features: 
Modeled the road network as a graph, with intersections represented as nodes and roads as edges.
Implemented the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm to find the shortest path between two points.
Used data structures such as heaps and priority queues to update routes dynamically in real-time as traffic data changed.
Incorporated historical traffic data to predict future traffic conditions and adjusted routes accordingly.
Developed a user-friendly interface that allowed users to input start and destination points and displayed the suggested route on a map.


##3. Hospital Management System

Features:
Utilized trees to store and manage patient records, ensuring efficient search and retrieval.
Implemented scheduling algorithms to manage doctor appointments and allocate time slots efficiently.
Applied hash tables to manage medical inventory, track stock levels, and generate alerts for low stock.
Developed efficient search and sorting algorithms to quickly find patient records and inventory items.
Ensured data security and privacy through encryption and access control mechanisms.
